# Conventions 

Within each category, the following sections may be observed: 
- A "See Also" section with flags that could be placed in this category but fit more closely with another category. (Each flag has only 1 entry across the whole repo)
- A table of flags, with descriptions and links. 
- A "High Profile Flags" section where flags with many links (i.e. commonly discussed and used) appear. Since Markdown has limited formatting and tables can become unwieldy for larger entries, flags with much content are moved out of the table and into paragraph form near the top


*Description*: Flags that are officially documented in BOL will have a "Doc<release>" tag at the beginning. The <release> is always the earliest release in which the flag was document, not necessarily the release in which the flag was introduced.
Flags that are *believed* to be informational-only have an "Info" tag at the beginning. Note, however that this repo cannot authoritatively guarantee whether a given flag is only informational; only official Microsoft documentation can do that.
For flags with longer descriptions and several different sources of info, the text is displayed in alternating normal/*italics* case to enable quick identification of the changes in source.

*Links*: The “Links” column contains hyperlinks to online content that provides a definition, detailed explanation, or practical example of using the trace flag. These links are typically KB articles, whitepapers, or blog articles from generally reputable sources (especially current or ex-Microsoft employees, and bloggers who demonstrate, in the author’s view, accuracy and trustworthy methodologies).
