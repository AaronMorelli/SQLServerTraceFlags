| 902 | Based on this [connect item](https://connect.microsoft.com/SQLServer/feedback/details/738612/sql-server-2012-cu1-upgrade-step-msdb110-upgrade-sql-encountered-error-547), it appears that 902 causes SQL Server to bypass “script upgrade” mode if the instance is still in that mode. *In the KB article, used as part of a workaround for starting SQL Server after a cumulative update has been applied on an instance that has a UCP. (Though what the flag specifically does is not clear from this article).* In the Technet blog post and the SQL Server Central blog post, the flag is used to halt/bypass an in-progress CU update that has gone horribly wrong. *Of minor interest is an old fix KB for SQL 2000 SP1, [KB290080](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/290080)* | [KB2163980](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2163980); [Technet](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/karthick_pk/archive/2010/11/18/sqlserver2008-script-level-upgrade-for-database-master-failed-because-upgrade-step-sqlagent100-msdb-upgrade-sql-encountered-error-574-state-0-severity-16.aspx); [SSC](http://www.sqlservercentral.com/blogs/everyday-sql/2015/07/07/use-trace-flag-902-to-recover-from-a-cumulative-update-failure/); | 
| 3408 | This forces SQL Server startup to use a single thread when recovering all DBs at SQL Server startup, instead of running through its algorithm for determining how many threads to allocate to DB recovery | [Nacho85] (http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ialonso/archive/2012/10/09/how-much-is-crash-recovery-parallelized-in-which-order-are-databases-recovered.aspx) |
| 3663 | CSS: “By default [SQL Server] allows system cache involvement [with writing to the SQL Error log] to avoid some of the performance issues you might be suspecting, but you can force it to use FILE_FLAG_WRITE_THROUGH” with TF 3663 | [CSS](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/psssql/archive/2011/01/07/discussion-about-sql-server-i-o.aspx) |
| 4022 | Directs the SQL instance to ignore stored procedures that have been configured as “auto-start” procedures. Their auto-start configuration is not affected, so the next time the instance is started w/o this flag they will return to their normal behavior. *The SSC TF repo adds: “Used to bypass automatically started (startup) procedures, this is a subset of startup option –f. TIP: Each SP consumes one worker thread while executing so you may prefer to make one startup procedure that calls others.”* Mentioned as far back as Ken Henderson’s “Guru’s Guide” books. | [MS Blog](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/sqlserverfaq/archive/2011/05/11/inf-hey-my-sql-server-service-is-not-starting-what-do-i-do.aspx) |

| 8010 |	Disables the “idle state” behavior that a SQL instance can enter (see TF 8009). The KB describes a “hung” condition that can occur on SQL 2008 R2 Express, and this TF can prevent that state from occurring. | [IO Basics Chapter2](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc917726.aspx); [KB2633271](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2633271/en-us); |
